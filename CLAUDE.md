# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev            # Start development server
pnpm build          # Production build (TypeScript and ESLint errors are intentionally ignored)
pnpm lint           # Run ESLint

# Lottery system scripts (run with tsx via pnpm)
pnpm run scrapper           # Run the Quiniela Buenos Aires scraper manually
pnpm run verificar-sorteos  # Check for pending sorteos and trigger winner selection
pnpm run cron-sorteos       # Same as verificar-sorteos (alias used for cron)
pnpm run prueba-rapida      # Quick smoke test against the database
```

There is no test runner configured in package.json. The `__tests__/` directory contains concurrency tests that require a live Supabase connection and are intended for manual invocation with `tsx`.

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env.local`:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `CRON_SECRET` — used to authenticate calls to `/api/verificar-sorteos`
- `MERCADOPAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN` — for MercadoPago payment integration
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — for transactional emails via Resend (the only notification channel)
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` — for Vercel Blob image storage

## Architecture

### Tech stack
Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript, Supabase (Postgres), Vercel Blob (images), MercadoPago (payments), Resend (email), Playwright (scraping), Tailwind + Radix UI (shadcn/ui components).

### Data layer (`lib/`)

- **`lib/supabase.ts`** — Supabase client singleton and all TypeScript interfaces (`Sorteo`, `Comprador`, `GanadorExpress`, etc.)
- **`lib/database.ts`** — All database operations. This is the single source of truth for data access. Key details:
  - `sorteoId === "default"` is a fallback path that reads/writes `localStorage` when no Supabase tables exist (dev/demo mode)
  - Number generation uses the PostgreSQL function `generar_numeros_unicos_atomico` to prevent race conditions under concurrent purchases. It serializes on a `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` per sorteo — not `FOR UPDATE`, which Postgres rejects alongside `unnest()`
  - Statistics use `obtener_estadisticas_sorteo` SQL RPC to avoid pulling all rows to the client
  - `obtenerGanadoresExpress` uses `obtener_ganadores_express_visibles` SQL RPC
  - Buyer lists are paginated in 1000-row pages to handle large sorteos

### Database schema

Core tables: `sorteos`, `compradores`, `ganadores_express`, `ganadores_pasados`, `mural_ganadores`, `sorteos_diarios`, and `configuracion` — a key-value store holding the transfer alias/titular, the site copy JSON (`contenido_sitio`) and the daily promo (`promo_diaria_*`).

This client sells chances directly — there is no digital-books gift. The `libros`/`libros_reclamados` tables, the `/libros` page and the backoffice tab were removed; if an older database still has those tables they are simply unused.

There is no WhatsApp bot: this client is email-only (Resend). Buyer `telefono` is still stored, but only so the backoffice can build manual `wa.me` links (`lib/telefono.ts`).

**`scripts/00-schema-completo.sql` is the single source of truth for the schema.** Run that one file in the Supabase SQL Editor to build a fresh database — tables, indexes, functions, triggers, RLS policies, storage buckets and the (empty) config keys. It is idempotent, so re-running it is safe. It consolidates the 32 numbered migrations the project used to carry; those were deleted and live only in git history.

The critical SQL objects are `generar_numeros_unicos_atomico` (atomic number assignment via advisory lock) and the `trigger_validar_numeros_unicos` trigger on `compradores`.

### Sorteo state machine

States: `activo` → `completo` → `sorteado` (or `cerrado` for manual closure).

- Transition to `completo` happens when `chancesVendidas >= total_chances`
- Transition to `sorteado` is triggered by the Vercel Cron (`/api/verificar-sorteos`, runs daily at 14:00 UTC) which calls the Playwright scraper to fetch the first number from Quiniela Buenos Aires and find the matching buyer

### Payment flows

Two payment methods co-exist:
1. **MercadoPago** — numbers assigned immediately on payment confirmation webhook (`/api/confirmar-pago`)
2. **Transferencia bancaria** — buyer uploads a payment proof; numbers are assigned only when admin approves via backoffice (`aprobarTransferencia` in `lib/database.ts`)

### Pages and routes

- `/` (`app/page.tsx`) — public landing: sorteo info, pack selection, buyer lookup by email
- `/backoffice` (`app/backoffice/page.tsx`) — admin panel (password-protected client-side via `components/admin-login.tsx`); manages buyers, transfers, images, sorteo settings, winner selection
- `/pago/exito|error|pendiente` — MercadoPago redirect pages
- `/terminos` — terms of service

API routes live in `app/api/`. Each corresponds to a specific action (create sorteo, confirm payment, upload image, etc.).

### Image storage

Images are uploaded to Vercel Blob via `/api/upload-image`. Sorteos support one main image and up to 8 carousel images (`carousel_image_1`…`carousel_image_8` columns on `sorteos`).

### Important invariants

- **Number uniqueness is enforced at the PostgreSQL level** via the `generar_numeros_unicos_atomico` function and the `trigger_validar_numeros_unicos` trigger (both in `scripts/00-schema-completo.sql`). Never bypass these by inserting `numeros_asignados` directly without going through `generarNumerosUnicos()`.
- Deleting a `compradores` row automatically frees its numbers for reassignment (no separate number-tracking table).
- Buyers with `es_ganador = true` cannot be deleted.
